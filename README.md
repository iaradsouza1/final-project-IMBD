# Applying classification algorithms to identify essential genes in model organisms.
Applying classification algorithms to identify essential genes in model organisms. 


This repository is destinated to the data and analyses performed in the final project from the "Introdução à Modelagem de Big Data (Introduction to Big Data Modelling)" course (https://introbigdata.org/).
Here I apply some classification algorithms, such as random forest and SVM, to classify genes from mouse and yeast as essential or not essential, based on evolutionary information.
